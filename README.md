## 🧪 M1: Core Systems and Creative Features

### 🔄 Player Movement
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration via **linear interpolation** (`lerp` in `player_system.cpp:221`).
- Player velocity gradually approaches the target, simulating realistic movement.

### 🎨 Rendering Effects
- **Chromatic aberration** when the player is hit.
- Pre-renders all map tiles into a single **framebuffer texture**, drastically improving frame performance.

### 🧱 Basic Physics & Collision
- Wall collisions redirect player movement using **normal vector projection**.
- Collision detection techniques:
  - **AABB** (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes)
  - **Circle-circle**
  - **SAT** (Separating Axis Theorem) for rotated rectangle collisions
  - **Swept collision** for high-speed projectiles

### 📷 Camera Controls
- The camera dynamically tracks and follows the player’s position.

### 🔊 Audio Feedback
- Includes:
  - Gunfire
  - Footsteps
  - Player hurt sound

---

## 🌑 M2: Shadows & Lighting

### 💡 2D Dynamic Shadows
- Light sources cast **real-time shadows** from walls and objects, enhancing visual depth and atmosphere.

---

## 🔦 M3: Advanced Lighting & AI

### ✨ 2.5D Lighting
- **Normal maps** on environment assets simulate realistic light reflections.
- Variations in reflection based on surface grooves and orientation.

### 🧠 Advanced Enemy AI
- Combines **A\*** pathfinding and **decision trees** for:
  - Engaging and retreating from the player
  - Investigating player’s last known location
- **Line-of-sight** detection with memory tracking

## 🎮 M4: Polish, Feedback, and Game Balance

### 🔊 Expanded Audio
- Over 12 sound effects for player actions and feedback, including:
  - Gunfire, reload, footsteps, dashing, pickups, melee, and more

### ⚖️ Game Balance (Based on User Feedback)
1. **Enemy Alert Sensitivity:**
   - Enemies now alert each other based on shots fired, room presence, and line-of-sight logic.

2. **Detection & Attack Distance:**
   - Attack range now spans screen height to prevent unfair off-screen deaths.
   - Pursuit range governed by line-of-sight instead of arbitrary distance.

3. **Weapon Tuning:**
   - Shotgun switched to single-round reload for vulnerability tradeoff.
   - Enemy weapons rebalanced for challenge and fairness.

4. **Enemy Reaction:**
   - Enemies have a turn rate and reaction delay before firing.
   - Accuracy tweaked to allow room for player counterplay.

5. **Dash Mechanic:**
   - Dash range and cooldown reduced to prevent overuse and add strategic value.

6. **Health Pickups:**
   - Health packs added to lower entry difficulty and allow recovery between fights.
